POSSIBLE STYLES: ["_", "b", "s", "i", "c"]
Takeaways:
1. The following block types act in a very similar way AND should accept similar styles:
  - to-do, header, sub-header, sub-sub-header, toggle, bulleted_list, numbered_list, quote, text, table of contents [styling should be applied differently though]
2. The following block types act a bit differently than above but are similar to one another in design and style:
  - page, callout [callout accepts same styles as above and can also have an icon, page can have an icon too]
3. The following block types are relatively unique in their creation and styling:
  - divider (accepts no styles)
  - image : No need for a title. looks like I'll need to send the image to S3 first, then retrieve it and create the block.
  - code: needs a language specified
  - equation: exact same as text but the args are a bit diff: ["‚Åç", [["e", "x = x^2"]]]
